# Causal-Inference-in-Ecosystems

## The first step: Causal Discovery
```
python Causal Discovery by PC Algorithm.py

--- input   1) correlation network files including nodes and edges info.  2) node abundance files.
--- output  directed network .gexf file 
```


## The second step: Causal Inference
```
python Causal Effects Estimation by DoWhy.py

--- input   1) correlation network files including nodes and edges info. 2) node abundance files.
--- output  causal effects of edges file
```
